Read some articles about SupaBase and I just finished thinking of what my MoApp would be... I was thinking of MoListings

an app for real estate agents to quickly generate property listings descriptions, captions, and formatted data for platforms like Zillow, Redfin, MLS, and Instagram based on simple inputs like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and uploaded house photos.

(I don't know if instagram applies to this since there already is a MoSocials... Also idk I don't really see houses on my feed but then again it's riddled with Brain Rot... I will research on this more later...)

I did some house searching and I found out that the inputs agents need to fill out are

Just practiced retrieving the listings from supabase... and I realized I needed photos as well and now I don't know how to do that

Forgot to journal this part but I finished setting up Supabase kinda nervous also I created the front end first since for me it's hard to start on the back end if I can't see it? Idk how to explain it but I used figma to design the landing page first so it's easier to edit yada yada yada... I also copied the style from MoLetters for the UI design and then I found a MoFlo Youtube video so I will copy that for the `/create` page... I'm most nervous for the `/create`

Sun Nov 23 2:43 AM Im working on the viewing stage... so like editing viewing the post seeing the information about the post... created Date... if it's posted or draft or what not... platforms as well... But I couldn't find the platform icons except for Zillow... Redfin or MLS don't have an Icon
