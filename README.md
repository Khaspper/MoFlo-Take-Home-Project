Read some articles about SupaBase and I just finished thinking of what my MoApp would be... I was thinking of MoListings

an app for real estate agents to quickly generate property listings descriptions, captions, and formatted data for platforms like Zillow, Redfin, MLS, and Instagram based on simple inputs like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and uploaded house photos.

(I don't know if instagram applies to this since there already is a MoSocials... Also idk I don't really see houses on my feed but then again it's riddled with Brain Rot... I will research on this more later...)

I did some house searching and I found out that the inputs agents need to fill out are

Just practiced retrieving the listings from supabase... and I realized I needed photos as well and now I don't know how to do that

Forgot to journal this part but I finished setting up Supabase kinda nervous also I created the front end first since for me it's hard to start on the back end if I can't see it? Idk how to explain it but I used figma to design the landing page first so it's easier to edit yada yada yada... I also copied the style from MoLetters for the UI design and then I found a MoFlo Youtube video so I will copy that for the `/create` page... I'm most nervous for the `/create`

Sun Nov 23 2:43 AM Im working on the viewing stage... so like editing viewing the post seeing the information about the post... created Date... if it's posted or draft or what not... platforms as well... But I couldn't find the platform icons except for Zillow... Redfin or MLS don't have an Icon

Going to take a nap but for the Filter by I decided to do All Active Draft and Sold then for Sort By I'll just do Newest and oldest and then View by I'll do Grid and table... I am stalling so hard for the create page I am so SCARED but the more I actually work on this project I realize that it'll be easier I kinda am happy that I am start Frontend first then Backend then Frontend then Backend then Frontend again... it actually makes it so easy for me at least... I like how I can see where my code is going it helps me understand it more... Anyways let's see if I can sleep it's 3:13 AM

Nov 24th 1:49 AM Supabase just suddenly stopped working... dude literally nothing changed... Just started panicking -\_- edit: It came back up
