1. What is the product's name (your Mo-Something app)?
MoListings

2. What is the function + connection?
MoListings helps real estate agents quickly create, organize, and manage property listings
The app guides agents through entering property details, setting platform export options, writing or using MoFlo's AI to create descriptions, 
and storing the listing data in a structured format in the DB and can be viewed in the view tab ('/view-listings').

Its connection to MoFlo is that it functions like other MoFlo “Mo-Something” tools:
It takes a business task that normally requires multiple steps and puts it into one guided process.
MoListings could plug into MoFlo Cloud as a real estate focused content module, 
giving real estate agents a fast way to create listing information that other MoFlo apps
(MoMail, MoSocial etc.) could later use to publish emails, posts, or updates automatically.

3. Why did you choose to make the product?
MoFlo apps take a specific business process and make it simpler, cleaner, and more automated. 
Real estate listing creation is a perfect example of a repetitive, detail heavy task that benefits from structure and consistency.
I wanted to create an integration that feels like it could realistically sit next to MoSocial, MoMail, and the other MoFlo tools.

4. Why would MoFlo clients (small and medium-sized businesses) be interested in and/or use this product?
Real estate SMBs spend significant time creating listings, rewriting descriptions, checking details, and prepping content for multiple platforms.
Ideally and theoretically MoListings removes the repetition by standardizing the listing creation process,
consistent formatting, reducing manual errors. This allows MoFlo clients to scale their workflows,
publish faster, and integrate listing creation with their other MoFlo tools.

5. What would you improve or change about the product in the future?
I would add true media storage, real integrations with Zillow/MLS APIs, multi-user accounts and create a better preview experience before publishing.
